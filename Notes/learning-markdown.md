<ul>
  <li> Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create websites, documents, notes, books, presentations, email messages, and technical documentation.</li>
  <li> Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text can be opened using virtually any application.  </li>
  <li> Markdown is platform independent. You can create Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating system. </li>

  <li> Markdown is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications support it.</li>
</ul>

###  __subject//___understanding-the-language

> A number of Markdown editors exist, both web and desktop-based, but you can, of course, use any old text editor. The only benefit that specific Markdown editors provide is a live-preview of the generated HTML, and, typically, some level of syntax highlighting.

 <ul>
  <li> <b> Paragraphs </b>- with Markdown, text is automatically converted into paragraphs where blocks of text are separated by a blank line.  </li>
  <li> <b> Headings </b>- begin a paragraph with a hashgtag, and that paragraph becomes a header. The number of " # " signifies the heading level number.</li>
  <li> <b> Blockquotes </b>- one of Markdown's major influences is plain-text email, and this is blaringly obvious, when you see that blockquotes are formatted exactly as they are in email: prefixed with a " > "</li>
  <li> <b> Code </b>- you can deliminate small inline code snippets, using the ` character around code. </li>
  <li> <b> Lists </b>-  comes naturally is in how you specify a list. Simply start a paragraph with " a * (or +, -) " to create an unordered list. Use numbers, 1., 2. etc. for ordered lists:</li>
  </ul>
