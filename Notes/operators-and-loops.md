# NOTES__// OPERATORS-AND-LOOPS

#### subject//___understanding expressions  

. //_<b> what are java expressions? </b>

> Expressions are essential building blocks of any Java program, usually created to produce a new value, although sometimes an expression assigns a value to a variable. Expressions are built using values, variables, operators and method calls.
<hr>

### . //_ java has three expressions 

<ul>
  <li> <b> a Value </b> </li>
  <li> <b> a Variable </b> </li>
  <li> <b>  Nothing ( Void ) </b> </li>
</ul>
 <hr>

#### subject//__understanding java operators

. //_<b>what are operators in java?</b>

> Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. Java divides the operators into the following groups.
<hr>

### . //_some of the operators 

 <ul>
  <li> <b> Arithmetic </b> </li>
  <li> <b> Assignment </b> </li>
  <li> <b> Comparison </b> </li>
  <li> <b> Logical </b> </li>
  <li> <b> Bitwise </b> </li>
  <li> <b> And many others.. </b> </li>
</ul>

#### subject//__understanding loops

. //_<b>what are loops?</b>

> Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.  think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another. There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.

### . //_some statements for loops
<ul>
  <li> <b> for </b> statment </li>
  <li> <b> do...while </b> statment </li>
  <li> <b> while </b> statment </li>
  <li> <b> labeled </b> statment </li>
  <li> <b> break </b> statment </li>
  <li> <b> continue </b> statment </li>
  <li> <b> for...in </b> statment </li>
  <li> <b> for...of </b> statment </li>
</ul>
