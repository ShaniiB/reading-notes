> Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

 <ul>
  <li> <b> Snapshot </b>- are of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it. </li>
  <li> <b> Local Operations </b>- allows for process expediency because a project’s history resides on the local disk, eliminating the need to fetch history information from the server, and allowing one to continue work on a project even when not online or on a VPN. </li>
  <li> <b> Tracking Change </b>- every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git. And, as the gatekeeper, Git will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit. </li>
  <li> <b> Loss of Data </b>- Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data. Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost. </li>
  <li> <b> States </b>- files in Git can reside in three main states: committed, modified and staged. </li>
</ul>
