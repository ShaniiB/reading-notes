### __subject//___what-is-html?  

> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).

### .snippet//__what-is-hypertext?

> "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.

###  __subject//___anatomy-of-an-html-element

<ul>
  <li>  <b> OPENING TAG </b> This consists of the name of the element, wrapped in opening and closing <b>angle brackets</b>. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins. </li>

  <li>  <b> CLOSING TAG </b> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results. </li>

  <li>  <b> CONTENT </b> This is the content of the element. </li>

  <li>  <b> ELEMENT </b> The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element. </li>

  <li>  <b> ATTRIBUTE </b> Are used to contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. The class attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value) with style information and other things. </li>
</ul>

<hr>

### .snippet//__attributes-should-always-have 

<ul>
  <li> A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes). </li>

  <li> The attribute name followed by an equal sign. </li>

  <li> The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks. </li>
</ul>

###  __subject//___what-is-a-wireframe?

> Wireframing is a way to design a website service at the structural level. A wireframe is commonly used to layout content and functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user journeys. Wireframes are used early in the development process to establish the basic structure of a page before visual design and content is added.

### .snippet//__remember-when-creating-a-wireframe

<ul>
  <li> <b> Clarity </b> Your wireframe needs to answer the questions of what that site page is, what the user can do there, and if it satisfies their needs. Your wireframe is an aid for you to visualize the layout of your site page and ensure that the user’s most important questions are answered and goals are achievable without being distracted by more aesthetic considerations.</li>

  <li> <b> Confidence </b> Ease of navigation through your site and clear calls-to-action increase user confidence in your brand. If your site page is unpredictable, or has buttons or boxes in unexpected places user confidence diminishes. A lot of this information can already be organized at the wireframing stage. Using familiar navigational processes and placing buttons in commonly-used and intuitive positions, user confidence will soar–and that’s before you’ve even gotten around to thinking about colors and styles. </li>
  
  <li> <b> Simplicity is key </b> Too much information, copy, or links, can be distracting to the user and will have a detrimental affect on your users’ ability to achieve their goals. You want your users to be able to find their way through your site with as little extra ‘fluff’ as possible, to the elements that map to their most significant goals in a given context. </li>
</ul>
