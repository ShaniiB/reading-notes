### __subject//___what-is-javascript?  

> JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

###  __subject//___learning-about-variables

> Variable means anything that can vary. JavaScript includes variables which hold the data value and it can be changed anytime.

> JavaScript uses reserved keyword var to declare a variable. A variable must have a unique name. You can assign a value to a variable using equal to (=) operator when you declare it or before using it..

###  __subject//___identifers-and-their-purpose

> All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers.

<ul>
  <li> Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. </li>
  <li> Names must begin with a letter. </li>
  <li> Names can also begin with $ and _ </li>
  <li> Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables) </li>
  <li> Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names </li>
</ul>
