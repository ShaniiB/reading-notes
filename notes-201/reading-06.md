<b>Document Object Model (DOM) </b> is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the <u> document structure, style, and content </u>. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.

A web page is a document, That document can be either displayed in the browser window or through HTML source -- its the same document in both cases the DOM represents that same document so it can be manipulated. <center> <b> The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a scripting language such as JavaScript. </b> </center>
