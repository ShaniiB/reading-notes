<b> Drawing rectangles </b>
<center> There are three functions that draw rectangles on the canvas. </center>

<li>fillRect(x, y, width, height) Draws a filled rectangle.</li>
<li>strokeRect(x, y, width, height) Draws a rectangular outline.</li>
<li>clearRect(x, y, width, height) Clears the specified rectangular area, making it fully transparent.</li>

<b> The Use of canvas </b>
<li> The canvas element has only two attributes, width and height. </li>
<li> The canvas element can be styled just like any normal image (margin, border, backgroundâ€¦). These rules, however, don't affect the actual drawing on the canvas. <li>
<li> The canvas is initially blank, to display something, a script first needs to access the rendering context and draw on it. </li>
