<hr>

<center> Objects groups together a set of variables and functions to create a model of whatever you want from thr real world. Objects let variables and functions take on new names. </center>

2 things : Variables become known as properties because of Object, and Functions are known as methods.

<center> Like variables and named functions, properties and methods have a name and value. In an object, that name is called a <b>Key</b>

Core Interfaces in the DOM
This section lists some of the most commonly-used interfaces in the DOM. The idea is not to describe what these APIs do here but to give you an idea of the sorts of methods and properties you will see very often as you use the DOM.

The document and window objects are the objects whose interfaces you generally use most often in DOM programming. In simple terms, the window object represents something like the browser, and the document object is the root of the document itself. Element inherits from the generic Node interface, and together these two interfaces provide many of the methods and properties you use on individual elements. These elements may also have specific interfaces for dealing with the kind of data those elements hold, as in the table object.
