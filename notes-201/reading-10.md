To add images to a page use the img inline element. The img element is a self-containing, or empty, element, which means that it doesnâ€™t wrap any other content and it exists as a single tag. You're also able to resize images and change the opacity easily through HTML & CSS.

You're even able to add your image as a background or take it a step further by using things like CSS3 Gradients in as a backgroud image. 

<li> Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally) </li>

<li> Radial Gradients (defined by their center) </li>
