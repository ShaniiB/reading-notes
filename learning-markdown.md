<h1> Here are my notes on GitHub Pages & Markdown. </h1>

<h2> Github Pages </h2>
<b>  Doesn't need severs or databases to funcation. </b>
<b> Github uses Jekyll to transform turn plain text into static websites. </b>
 <ul>
 <li><b> Repositories </b> are used to showcase things like portfolios, documentations and even projects. </li>
</ul>
